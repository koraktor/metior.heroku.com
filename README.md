3Metior on Heroku
================

This web application provides a simple way to generate statistics for projects
hosted on GitHub. Just enter the user and project name and hit "Generate
stats!".

It is built using Rails, Metior and Heroku's application platform.

## Future plans

* Generate more reports
* Smarter caching
* Tighter integration into GitHub, e.g. for listing repositories or analyzing
  private repositories

## Contribute

Metior and this Rails app are open-source. Therefore you are free to help
improving them. There are several ways of contributing to Metior's development:

* Build apps using it and spread the word.
* Report problems and request features using the [issue tracker][2].
* Write patches yourself to fix bugs and implement new functionality.
* Create a Metior fork on [GitHub][1] and start hacking. Extra points for using
  feature branches and GitHub's pull requests.
